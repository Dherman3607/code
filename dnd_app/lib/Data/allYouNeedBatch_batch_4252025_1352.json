As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 2O-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes.

The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow.

The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least SO feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage.\nOn a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.\n\nA creature Blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This spell dispels Darkness in its area that was created by any spell.","source":{"book":"Player's Handbook 2024","sourceType":"canon"},"additionalInfo":"","casters":{"sorcerer":false,"bard":false,"paladin":false,"druid":false,"warlock":false,"cleric":false,"wizard":false,"ranger":false},"level":8,"range":"150 feet","isStandard":false,"castingTime":"1 Action","school":"Evocation","tags":"Type: Spell"}},{"name":"Astral Projection 2024","isCustom":true,"isPrepared":false,"customSpell":{"duration":"Until Dispelled","components":"V, S, M (for each of the spell’s targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)","name":"Astral Projection 2024","appliedDamageIndex":0,"allCasterNames":["Cleric 2024","Warlock 2024","Wizard 2024"],"isConcentration":false,"damageDice":[],"isRitual":false,"officialDescription":"You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.\n\nA target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut-which happens only when an effect states that it does so-the target's body and astral form both die.\n\nA target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.\n\nAny damage or other effects that apply to an as- tral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.\n\nWhen the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Player's Handbook 2024"},"additionalInfo":"","casters":{"sorcerer":false,"bard":false,"paladin":false,"druid":false,"warlock":false,"cleric":false,"ranger":false,"wizard":false},"level":9,"range":"10 feet","isStandard":false,"castingTime":"1 hour","school":"Necromancy","tags":"Type: Spell"}},{"name":"Gate 2024","isCustom":true,"isPrepared":false,"customSpell":{"duration":"Concentration, up to 1 minute","components":"V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP)","name":"Gate 2024","appliedDamageIndex":0,"allCasterNames":["Cleric 2024","Sorcerer 2024","Warlock 2024","Wizard 2024"],"damageDice":[],"isConcentration":true,"isRitual":false,"officialDescription":"You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the portal's destination is visible through it.\n\nThe portal has a front and a hack on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\n\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens next to the named creature and transports it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Player's Handbook 2024"},"additionalInfo":"","casters":{"sorcerer":false,"bard":false,"paladin":false,"druid":false,"warlock":false,"cleric":false,"wizard":false,"ranger":false},"level":9,"range":"60 ft.","castingTime":"1 Action","isStandard":false,"school":"Conjuration","tags":"Type: Spell"}},{"name":"True Resurrection 2024","isCustom":true,"isPrepared":false,"customSpell":{"duration":"Instantaneous","components":"V, S, M (diamonds worth 25,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)","name":"True Resurrection 2024","appliedDamageIndex":0,"allCasterNames":["Cleric 2024"],"isConcentration":false,"damageDice":[],"isRitual":false,"officialDescription":"You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age.
