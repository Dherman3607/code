The dragon turtle presented in the Monster Manual is a typical adult, at least a century old and boasting a valuable hoard. You can use the stat blocks in this section for older or younger dragon turtles. In addition, chapter 5 includes lair actions and regional effects that can be used for adult or ancient dragon turtles. An ancient dragon turtle is a mythic creature akin to a greatwyrm, combining the power of multiple echoes from across the worlds of the Material Plane. Such a creature can be as large as an island— and indeed, legends suggest that many unwitting sailors wrecked at sea have mistaken slumbering dragon turtles for solid ground.\n\nAncient dragon turtles might sleep for years or decades while floating along the surface of the ocean, enjoying the warmth of the sun and letting vegetation take root on their shells. An angry ancient dragon turtle is terrible to behold, radiating heat from the shell to boil the surrounding water—and any creatures in it. And even if an enemy wears down the dragon turtle’s defenses, magical storms manifest to shield the dragon turtle and strike at foes.\n\nCreating a Dragon Turtle\nUse the Dragon Turtle Personality Traits and Dragon Turtle Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive dragon turtle characters, and use the Dragon Turtle Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon. (Though the Monster Manual doesn’t explicitly include dragon turtles in the variant rules for making a dragon a spellcaster, you can apply those rules to these aquatic dragons.)\n\nDragon Turtle Personality Traits\nd8\tTrait\n1\tI speak slowly and deliberately, pausing to reflect after (or sometimes in the middle of) each utterance.\n2\tI am more interested in the shiny baubles people carry than in anything they have to say.\n3\tI think of ships as kindred spirits and like to rub affectionately against their keels.\n4\tI like to show visitors the vastness of my domain, so they appreciate how insignificant they are.\n5\tI attack anyone I notice taking from the sea’s bounty without offering something in return.\n6\tI think of sailors’ songs as their “water speech” and try to converse with them by humming snippets of tunes I have overheard.\n7\tI swim alongside ships sailing through my domain, just out of arrow range, so they know I am watching.\n8\tI am fascinated by the politics of surface realms and talk endlessly with sailors and adventurers to stay current on the latest happenings on land.\nDragon Turtle Ideals\nd6\tIdeal\n1\tEndurance. We who dwell beneath the waves can weather all storms. (Any)\n2\tIndifference. What do I care for the fleeting concerns of those who crawl upon the land? (Any)\n3\tCuriosity. I want to know about everything that enters my domain, especially oddities from the surface world. (Any)\n4\tSupremacy. Creatures who refuse to recognize my rule over these waters suffer my displeasure. (Lawful or Evil)\n5\tPreservation. I am the ocean’s steward, tending reefs and waters to ensure that they remain unspoiled. (Lawful)\n6\tEradication. The peoples of the surface world were a mistake of creation.

Now the sword must be found, and only a dragon turtle remembers where it is.\n7\tA dragon turtle has taken up residence in a subterranean lake, and the steam has been driving other creatures up out of their tunnels toward the surface.\n8\tA sea god has sent a dragon turtle to unleash devastation along a populated coast.\n\nConnected Creatures\nDragon turtles are stolid and slow to anger. This temperament, combined with their disinterest in moral quandaries, allows them to get along with—or at least abide—most creatures they encounter. They frequently enter symbiotic relationships with other sea creatures that can bring them food or treasure, and they sometimes agree to work for creatures who ply them with generous sums of wealth.\n\nAncient Dragon Turtle Connections\nd4\tConnected Creatures\n1\tAn ancient dragon turtle and an ancient gold dragon meet once a year to trade moves in a game of dragonchess that has been going on for centuries.\n2\tAn ancient dragon turtle serves as counsel to an empyrean court, tempering the Celestials’ passions with the dragon turtle’s endless patience.\n3\tA geas spell forces an ancient dragon turtle to carry a lich’s tower.\n4\tAn ancient dragon turtle is responsible for ensuring that a kraken is never woken from its slumber.\nDragon Turtle Lairs\nDragon turtles make their lairs in underwater caves and coral reefs. Most such lairs are situated deep beneath the waves near the ocean’s floor, though some dragon turtles prefer coastal lairs with easier access to settlements they can trade with—or prey upon. Particularly reclusive dragon turtles seek lairs in even more remote locales, including deep-sea trenches or underwater volcanoes.\n\nDragon turtles are largely unconcerned with the design of their lairs and seldom work to improve them. A dragon turtle’s primary concern when selecting a lair is ensuring that the site is large enough to accommodate the creature’s prodigious size as the centuries wear on. After that, proximity to shipping lanes and freedom from irksome neighbors take precedence.\n\nDragon Turtle Lair Features\nThe underwater caves inhabited by dragon turtles are structurally similar to the seaside caverns where bronze and topaz dragons lair. When constructing a dragon turtle’s lair, you can simply take a coastal map and translate it to an underwater environment or use the map as-is if the dragon turtle is content to lair near the surface.\n\nAs an example, map 5.14 depicts a topaz dragon’s lair in a seaside cavern, but it could be reimagined as a grotto in the side of a coral reef rising from a shelf on the ocean floor, with the following features:\n\nShelf Floor. The sandy beaches represent the ocean floor at a depth of 100 feet, which is coated in a soft layer of fine sediment. The water around the lair is clear but dimly lit. The water’s edge on the map represents the lip of the shelf, which descends to a dark plain twelve hundred feet below.\n\nCoral Reef. The rocky cliff side depicts the contours of a coral reef that rises 80 feet above the shelf. The exterior face of the reef is covered with stinging corals.\n\nReef Hollow. The dragon turtle’s lair lies in a hollow in the reef’s interior that was bored out by a giant sea worm the dragon turtle killed. The original entrance at the level of the shelf floor ascends through a weed-choked tube that opens into the main chamber. Here, the dragon turtle nests in a recessed shelf along the back wall, where the creature can gaze down at the hoard scattered across the chamber floor. Although the lair is mostly flooded with seawater, a layer of breathable air is trapped in the top 3 feet of the main chamber.\n\nCoral Shelf. A secondary entrance grants access to a coral shelf 40 feet above the shelf floor and illuminates the lair for a few hours each day with a shaft of dim sunlight.\n\nLair Actions\nAs they are presented in the Monster Manual, dragon turtles don’t have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, you can give an adult or ancient dragon turtle access to lair actions, increasing its challenge rating by 1. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon turtle can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:\n\nBlasting Current. A strong water current moves through the dragon turtle’s lair. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be moved 30 feet in a direction of the dragon turtle’s choice. On a success, the creature is moved 10 feet instead.\n\nEntangling Kelp. Strands of spectral kelp reach out to ensnare creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the lair that the dragon turtle can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.\n\nSteam Eruption. Steam erupts in a 15-foot cone from a point on the ground the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn’t grant creatures resistance to this damage.\n\nRegional Effects\nThe region containing a dragon turtle’s lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\nDiverting Currents. Underwater currents push unwanted visitors away from the lair. While swimming in these currents, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), even if a creature has a swimming speed.\n\nElemental Portals. Crevasses on the ocean floor within 1 mile of the dragon turtle’s lair form two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing creatures of elemental water into the world to dwell nearby.\n\nHot Water. Geothermal vents heat the water within 6 miles of the dragon turtle’s lair to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIf the dragon turtle dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.","movement":{"speed":30,"fly":-1,"swim":60,"burrow":-1,"hover":-1,"climb":-1},"source":{"book":"Fizban's Treasury of Dragons","sourceType":"canon","page":0},"hpDice":{"num":21,"base":189,"type":20},"tags":"Type: Monster","race":"Dragon","name":"Ancient Dragon Turtle","monsterTraits":[{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"24 (62,000 XP)","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Challenge","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"DEX +8, CON +16, WIS +11","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Saving Throws","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"The dragon turtle can breathe air and water","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Amphibious","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"Truesight 120 ft., Passive Perception 21","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Senses","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"Aquan, Draconic","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Languages","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"The dragon turtle doesn't require food or drink.","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Unusual Nature","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"Charmed, Frightened, Poisoned","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Condition Immunities","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"Perception +11","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","name":"Skills","type":"trait","toHit":-1,"reach":"","attackType":"","range":""},{"damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"If the dragon turtle would be reduced to 0 hit points, its current hit point total instead resets to 350 hit points, and it recharges its Steam Breath.

Since fleeing the First World, he has made his home in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia and is often numbered among the gods of that plane. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. In the most dire situations, a powerful follower of Bahamut who makes a tremendous sacrifice—a vast hoard or even the follower’s own life—might convince the god to send aid to the world in the form of a divine aspect. This aspect is a physical manifestation of the Platinum Dragon, carrying his memories and will—and a significant portion of his formidable strength.\n\nBahamut’s aspect displays the full glory of the Platinum Dragon, towering over even ancient dragons. Covered in platinum scales, his physical features combine various elements of the five kinds of metallic dragons—according to some scholars, combining them in different ways with each manifestation of the aspect. But Bahamut is also fond of traveling the Material Plane in disguise, so his aspect might appear as a wizened old sage, a young monk, or a songbird. In any form, Bahamut’s aspect is often accompanied by seven ancient gold dragons who favor disguising themselves as canaries.\n\nIn combat, Bahamut’s enemies experience the full force of his justice, while his allies enjoy the full benefit of his mercy. His breath can wreak monumental destruction and work miraculous healing, and few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm.","alignments":{"lawfulGood":true},"sizes":{"gargantuan":true},"movement":{"speed":60,"fly":120,"swim":60,"hover":-1,"burrow":60,"climb":-1},"name":"Aspect of Bahamut","skills":{"persuasion":true,"insight":true,"perception":true},"challengeRating":30,"ac":23,"acString":"natural armor","bonusActions":[{"range":"","toHit":0,"name":"Change Shape","reach":"","additionalDescription":"","targetType":"","attackType":"","type":"bonusAction","actionDescription":"The aspect magically transforms into any Humanoid or Beast, while retaining his game statistics (other than his size).

The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.\n\nIn both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath.

The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.\n\nIn both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath.

The competitive avarice of dragonkind and the interference of adventurers prevent most dragons from attaining this level of power. But a chromatic dragon who can outwit all rivals and overcome all potential thieves can rise to become one of the mightiest of dragons.\n\nOften a chromatic greatwyrm’s ascension involves fusing the power of a single dragon’s echoes across different worlds of the Material Plane. The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.\n\nIn both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath. They no longer need to eat or drink, as their vast hoards magically sustain them.

The competitive avarice of dragonkind and the interference of adventurers prevent most dragons from attaining this level of power. But a chromatic dragon who can outwit all rivals and overcome all potential thieves can rise to become one of the mightiest of dragons.\n\nOften a chromatic greatwyrm’s ascension involves fusing the power of a single dragon’s echoes across different worlds of the Material Plane. The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.\n\nIn both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath. They no longer need to eat or drink, as their vast hoards magically sustain them. And their power can raze a city to the ground, destroying buildings and defenders alike.","race":"Dragon","skills":{"intimidation":true,"stealth":true,"perception":true},"actions":[{"toHit":0,"targetType":"","damageDice":[],"actionDescription":"The greatwyrm makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.","type":"action","reach":"","attackType":"","range":"","name":"Multiattack","additionalDescription":""},{"toHit":18,"targetType":"single target","damageDice":[{"dice":{"num":2,"base":10,"type":8},"damageType":"slashing","standardDamage":19}],"actionDescription":"","type":"action","reach":"10 ft.","attackType":"Melee","range":"","name":"Claw","additionalDescription":".
